# Club Manager Client

This repository contains code for the Club Manager application front-end. This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn install`

Installs all of the required dependencies in the node_modules directory.

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn run lint`

Runs ESLint to ensure that your code is conforming to standards.

### `yarn run lint-style`

Runs StyleLint to ensure that Sass/CSS files are conforming to standards.

### `yarn run test`

We don't currently run any automated UI tests due to a rapidly changing interface - they are on the way though! Running this script will execute whatever pre-bundled tests the boilerplate maintainer included.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!
